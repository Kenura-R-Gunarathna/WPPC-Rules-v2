Not more than three interim questions may be asked
for the purpose of seeking elucidation to an answer
given for any oral question. If the member in whose
name the question stands does not ask such interim
questions another member may ask such interim
questions. Interim questions shall not introduce
matters which are not relevant to the scope of the
original question.
