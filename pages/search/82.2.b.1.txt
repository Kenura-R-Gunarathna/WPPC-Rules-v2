Twenty other members of the Council, who
are not ministers, shall be nominated by the
Chairman of the Provincial Council for an
Advisory Committee. Such nominations
shall, as far as possible reflect the relative
membership strength of recognized political
parties and independent groups in the
Council and shall be in such manner as to
represent the Districts comprising the
Province.
