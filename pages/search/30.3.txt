When a Minister who is due to answer a question is
not present owing to an unavoidable reason, another
Minister or Leader of the House with the consent of
the member who asked the question may answer the
question on the Minister's behalf. If the Member
raises interim questions they shall be answered by the
Minister in-charge of the relevant subject or by the
Leader of the House at the next Council sitting.
