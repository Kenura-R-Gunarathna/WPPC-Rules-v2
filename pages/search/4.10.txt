In the event of more than two candidates contesting
for the election to be selected as Chairman, if any one
candidate does not poll a number of votes exceeding
the total number of votes polled by all the other
candidates, the candidate who has polled the lowest
number of votes shall be excluded from the election
and the election shall be held again. Thus the election
shall proceed as expedient, excluding the candidate
who has polled the lowest number of votes from the
election after each round of election until any one
candidate polls a number of votes exceeding the
number of votes polled by the remaining candidate or
the total number of votes polled by all the remaining
candidates.
