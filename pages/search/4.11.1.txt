In a contest among three candidates or more in an
election by ballot, when one of those candidates has to
be excluded under Rule 4(10) herein in an instance
where two or more candidates have polled an equal
number of votes, selection of the candidate who
should be excluded from among the candidates who
have polled an equal number of votes shall be made
by an election held again by ballot between the two
relevant candidates. In such election too, if there is an
equality of votes, the candidate to be excluded shall
be identified by drawing lots as decided by the
Secretary.
