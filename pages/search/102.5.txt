Whenever the Committee on Provincial Public
Accounts does report either that an excess has been
incurred on a programme or that it does disallow 
certain items of expenditure, a motion to resolve the
Council into a Committee to consider a grant to make
good such an excess or such items as have been
disallowed may be caused to be included in the
agenda by the Minister in Charge of the subject of
Finance for consideration on a day to be fixed by that
Minister. No such motion shall be entertained after
31st December of the year next but one after that to
which the excess relates. Provided that the Provisions
in this rule shall not apply to the excess submitted for
approval of the Provincial Council, incurred prior to
31st December of that date that this manual of Rules
of Procedure is ordered to be implemented. The
Provincial Council shall be entitled to approve such
excess on the recommendation of the Provincial
Public Accounts Committee.
