The quorum for a Committee of the whole Council
shall be the same as that provided for the Council. In
every instance where in a Committee of the Whole
Council, the absence of a quorum is noticed by the
Chairman or is brought to his attention by any other
member, he shall order the division bells to be rung
and if at the expiration of five minutes a quorum is
not present, the Committee of the Whole Council
shall convert to Council. If no quorum is present
again the Chairman shall adjourn the Council or
suspend the meeting until there is a quorum. In
counting a quorum in Committee, the Chairman shall
be included.
